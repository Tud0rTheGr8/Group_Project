- How do average race completion times vary over time?
- What factors affect the rank achieved by race drivers?
- To predict which teams are more likely to win certain races.
- To gain insights into how some teams build their cars.

# tidying data

- The city in which each race was held is mutated as race_city in order to get a variable represents different race tracks.

- A few cities which had the largest number of races is selected to prevent effects of track difference.

- A graph showcasing the evolution of rank 1 times over the seasons in selected cities is created.

- Different lines are plotted correspond to each city.

# Prediction

class: middle

# Our expectations

We assume that rank 1 times would go down over the seasons <br> as the drivers gain more experience with the tracks and as the technology in the cars advances.

# Are Cars Different?

We wanted to conduct research in was whether different teams build their cars differently and how this would affect their probability of achieving a high rank on certain tracks.

---
# Our Prediction

If a team performs better on tracks with many long straight lines than on tracks with many turns, then it may suggest that this team builds cars with high top speed and acceleration in a straight line, but poorer maneuverability
